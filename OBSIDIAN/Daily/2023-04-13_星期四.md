1. We deployed a script loop to check and remove all users on the Vizlib platform who last access before 2023.The offline version extension is not in sync user access accounts, so our access account on the Vizlib platform is clean now. I have exported a list of accessors for your reference, please let me know if more needs to be removed, thanks again.😊

| Extension name | Removed inactive accounts | Now used |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Library        | 2,167                     | 694      |
| Self-Service   | 25                        | 230      |
